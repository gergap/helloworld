Manual Build instructions
-------------------------

# create a build folder for out-of-source build
mkdir bld
cd bld
# create a makefile
cmake ../src
# build the application
make
# execute unit tests
make test
# create setups
make package

For Nightly builds
------------------

TODO: Explain what the build targets Nightly, Experimental are for.

make Nightly

Attention:
Coverage test is only supported on Linux using GCC.
Make sure to fulfill these requirements.

* gcov must be installed
* You MUST NOT use ccache! Otherwise compilation with coverage information may fail.

CPack is able to create several installation formats, from Windows installers to Linux RPM and DEB formats,
tarballs and self-extracting tar archives.
